# WatchMyDog
A real-time dog-watching app using Node.js and React, with web sockets to broadcast a camera stream to any device.

## Why
I have a very scared and naughty dog that makes weird stuff when I'm not around so I thought it would be fun
to create a way to watch what his doing from my phone.

This project could help you with any similar problem, maybe you want to spy something/someone, who knows...

## Features
- Real-time streaming of your dog using web sockets
- Accessible from any device with a web browser
- User-friendly interface to manage camera settings
- Funny sounds that you can play to attract your dog to the camera
- Basic authentication based on secret password to avoid streaming to strangers ðŸ¥´
